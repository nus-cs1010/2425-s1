## What is a program?

---
class: middle,center

### A sequence of step-by-step instructions given to computers to process data in order to perform a certain task.

### How CPU Executes a Program


.fit[![simplified](../notes/figures/cpu-memory/cpu-memory-pdf.png)]

.tiny[(A highly simplfied view)]

---
### Machine Code

- Instructions that can be interpreted by a CPU

- Different CPU architecture may use different instruction sets

`1001010001011110100010101010101000101`

---
### Assembly Language

- Use mnemonic to represent the instructions such as `incr`, `decr`, `store`, etc. in a more human-readable way.

- Still difficult to write: operation that is conceptually simple still requires multiple instructions to be issued.

---
### Higher-Level Language

- Allow programmers to express an operation closer to their intention

- E.g., $x = x + y$ if $y < 0$


---
### Higher-Level Languages

- FORTRAN (first popular programming language from 1950s)

- C (1972, still influential today)

- [Many many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)

### Why C?

- It lets you have more control over how you use memory.  
- It forces students to think and understand how machine works.
- It is fast.

Important for InfoSec and CEG students.

### Computational problems 

- are problems that can be solved _step-by-step_ by a computer

- have _well-defined_ inputs, outputs, and constraints

---

### Types of Computational Problems:

1. Decision problems (e.g. Is there a path from point A to point B on a map?)

--

2. Search problems (e.g. Output a path from point A to point B if it exists.)

--

3. Optimization problems (e.g. Output the _shortest_ path from point A to point B if it exists.)

---

---
class: center

### Let's start with an experiment:
What I need you to do:
--


Pay special attention to your methods and strategy on how you solve the given problem.


---
class: center

#### Find the maximum among this list of numbers:

```
5  9  8
1  3  2
```
--
So what was your strategy?

---
class: center

### How about now? What's the maximum number here?

```
]

--

What was your strategy this time?

---
class: top

### How close does this match what you tried?

--

1. Scan the integers one-by-one

--

2. Keep track of the "max so far"

--

3. When we are done scanning, the "max so far" will be the answer.


---
class: top

### Did you do any of the following:

--

1. Use an arbitrary/random sequence to go through the numbers?

--

2. Look at groups of numbers at a go?

--

3. Double back to look at the same numbers you already did?

---
class: top

### Computational Thinking:

The thing is, computers aren't exactly like humans. 
They don't look at the list like this:

.fit[![](../notes/figures/lec01/lookall.jpeg)]

---
class: top

### Computational Thinking:
It's easier for them to process singular values one by one:

.footnote[This is not entirely true, but that is a very advanced topic.]

---
class: top

### Computational Thinking:
Also, they are very good at following precise instructions. 
So we will try to get them to read the list in a _fixed sequence_.
E.g. From first number to last number.

---
class: top

### Computational Thinking:
Lastly, computers are really good at remembering things. 
So unlike us humans, they don't need to "double back" to re-check their results.

---
class: top


### Computational Thinking:
Let's try to be less human 🤖 and try to get a computer 
to follow the same strategy.

--

To do this, we need to do a few things:

--
1. A problem formulation. (So that we know what the computer is given as input.)

--
2. A fixed set of instructions. (This describes the strategy to implement.)

---
class: top

### Step 1: General Problem Formulation

- Input: $L$ = $\langle l\_0,...,l\_{k-1\} \rangle$

- Output: $m$

- Constraint $m$ should be from the input list $L$ and $m$ is the largest value 
among all of the values in $L$.

---
class: top 

### Step 2: Designing an implementable strategy.

But wait! We haven't told what kind of steps computers can make. And this is tricky


---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>.

---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>.
 Here, <span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span> is stored in _variables_.

- E.g. $m$ could be a variable remembers the maximum value seen so far.

---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>.
 Here, <span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span> is stored in _variables_.

- E.g. $m$ could be a variable remembers the maximum value seen so far.

- We can also _read_ and _write_ values to variables.
E.g. $m = 5$ sets $m$ to $5$. $m = z$, sets $m$ to whatever value $z$ had.
---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>. 
<span style="color:red"><u>Data</u></span> can also be stored in _lists_.
- E.g. our input is in the form of a list $L = \langle l\_0,...,l\_{k-1\} \rangle$.

--

- E.g. $l_0$ gives us the first element of $L$. And $l_1$ gives us the second element of $L$, and so on.
---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>. 
<span style="color:red"><u>Data</u></span> can also be stored in _lists_.

Important Note: A _variable_ has a corresponding location in computer memory, and it holds a value.
---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>.
 To <span style="color:blue"><u>manipulate</u></span> data, we operate on the variables.

---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>.
 To <span style="color:blue"><u>manipulate</u></span> data, we operate on the variables.

- We will allow comparisons $<, >, =$, and basic arithmetic operations ($+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$, $mod$).  

---
class: top 

### Step 2 Detour: The Program Model.

We think of a program as something that 
<span style="color:blue"><u>manipulates</u></span> 
<span style="color:red"><u>data</u></span>.
 To <span style="color:blue"><u>manipulate</u></span> data, we operate on the variables.

- We will allow comparisons $<, >, =$, and basic arithmetic operations ($+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$, $mod$).  

- E.g. $value = value + 1$ will take $value$ and increment it by $1$.
---
class: top

### Step 2: Back at it. Our input:

- $L$ : The list of numbers being scanned.
- $k$ : The size of the list (or number of values).

---
class: top

### Step 2: Declare our program variables:

- $m$ : The maximum value so far.
- $i$ : Index into the list.

--

We will set $m = l_0$ and $i = 1$. 

---
class: top

### Step 3: Finally, the computation: 

1. Compare $m$ with $l_i$.

--

2. If $m < l_i$, then update $m$ by setting $m = l_i$.

--

3. Then to scan the next element, we set $i = i + 1$.

---
class: top

### Done scanning?

- Done _after_ we have scanned $l_{k - 1}$ (remember this is the last element!).

- This happens when $i = k$. So when we realise $i = k$, we stop.
$m$ now contains the maximum element of $L$.
--


(Pop quiz: Why when $i = k$ and not $i = k - 1$?).

---
class: top

### Think about what $i$ represents:

.fit[ ![:scale 45%](../notes/figures/lec01/trace0.png) ]

This is our initial program state.

---
class: top

### Think about what $i$ represents:

.fit[ ![:scale 45%](../notes/figures/lec01/trace1.png) ]

After one iteration.

---
class: top

### Think about what $i$ represents:

.fit[ ![:scale 45%](../notes/figures/lec01/trace2.png) ]

After another iteration.


---
class: top

### Think about what $i$ represents:

.fit[ ![:scale 50%](../notes/figures/lec01/trace3.png) ]

After the final iteration.

---
class: top

### Think about what $i$ represents:

.fit[ ![:scale 25%](../notes/figures/lec01/trace3.png) ]

Notice: The variable $i$ represents the total number of scanned elements.

--
E.g. When $i = 2$, $m$ is the max of the first $2$ elements.

--
So when $i = k$, $m$ is the max of the first $k$ elements (i.e. all of them).

---
class: top

### To summarize:

- Given list of numbers $L$, of size $k$. 
- Set $m = l_0$, and $index = 1$.
- Update $m$ to be the larger of $m$ and $l_i$.
- Increment $i$. 
- Stop when $i = k$.

---
class: top
background-color: white

### Here's how you can picture it with a flowchart.

.fit[![](../notes/figures/max-flowchart/max-flowchart-pdf-0.png)]

--
Let's try going through the flowchart.

---
class: top

### Did you notice? 

We've not done any C but we're quite close to having a program.

---
class: top

### These steps to solve a computational problem form the _algorithm_.

--
The algorithm is how you _describe_ the solution. In CS1010, we'll use C 
to _implement_ it.

--

Note Bene: A good approach is to think of how to solve the problem conceptually first.
And _then_ implement it in C. (We've done the conceptual solving today.)

---
class: top

### How do we know the algorithm is correct?

--
* Just because an algorithm outputs the correct value on some inputs, it does not necessarily mean it's correct.

--
* For an algorithm to be correct it has to be correct on _all possible inputs_.

---
class: top


#### For example, outputting if a number is odd:

.center[.fit[![:scale 70%](../notes/figures/lec01/incorrect1.png)]]

---
class: top


#### For example, outputting if a number is odd:

.center[.fit[![:scale 70%](../notes/figures/lec01/incorrect2.png)]]

---
class: top

### Later in the course:

* Will cover methods on how to show correctness.

* Will cover how to come up with good test cases.

---
### Homework (Preparing for labs)
